There are key differences between User Rules and .cursorrules and .cursor/* :

## Purpose:
User Rules (in Cursor Settings): Define how the AI assistant should think and respond during conversations (thinking process, reasoning approach, output format)
.cursorrules: Define project-specific technical standards and conventions (architecture, testing, code quality, etc.)
